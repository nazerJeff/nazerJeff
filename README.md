- 👋 Hi, I’m @nazerJeff
- 👀 I’m interested in sharing a C++ Class library that I developed that works like JSON in JavaScript but with C++.  I hope that someone will help me convert it from "C with classes" to real C++ syntax 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning How to use GitHub
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving my shared libraries 
- 📫 How to reach me I can be reached at jeff@hertig.org
- 😄 Pronouns: What does this have to do with software?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm old, I taught myself C in 82' and C++ in 94'.  Unfortunately, never taking a C or C++ class my C++ code (while functional) looks like C code that just happens to use classes.
